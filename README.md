# Usage

## Terminology
This documentation uses a number of different concepts to describe the functionality of Emthree. Please refer to the list below to better understand how Emthree works.

### Board
A grid of slots where the game is played.

![](images/board.png)

### Slot
A position on the board. A slot can hold a block.

![](images/slot.png)

### Block
A block represents an element in a slot on the board. It could be fish, candy, cakes or something else, fitting the theme of the game. Blocks will fall if there are free slots below them. Blocks have a color and an optional type.

![](images/block.png)

### Blocker
A blocker represents an element in a slot on the board that is static. It will not fall and it will stop blocks from falling any further. Blockers have an optional type.

### Spawner
A spawner represents an element in a slot on the board that creates/spawns blocks. It will not fall and it will stop blocks from falling any further. Spawners have an optional type.

### Match
Three or more blocks of the same color is considered a match.

### Stable Board
A board is considered stable when the board doesn't contain any matches and all slots are filled with blocks.


## EmthreeAPI - The basics

### emthree.create_board(width, height, block_size)
Create an Emthree board of the specified dimensions

**PARAMETERS**
* ```width``` (number) - Board width in blocks
* ```height``` (number) - Board height in blocks
* ```block_size``` (number) - Size of a block
* ```config``` (table) - Optional table with board configuration values

The `config` table can contain the following values:
* ```remove_duration``` - Time in seconds to wait while removing blocks
* ```swap_duration```  Time in seconds for the swap animation
* ```slide_duration``` - Time in seconds for the slide animation
* ```collapse_duration``` - Time in seconds for the collapse animation
* ```collapse_direction``` - Direction to move blocks in when collapsing the board after removing blocks. Can be one of `emthree.COLLAPSE_UP`, `emthree.COLLAPSE_DOWN`, `emthree.COLLAPSE_LEFT` or `emthree.COLLAPSE_RIGHT`
* ```slide_easing``` - Easing function to apply when sliding blocks. Any of the `go.EASING_*` constants.
* ```collapse_easing``` - Easing function to apply when collapsing blocks. Any of the `go.EASING_*` constants.

**RETURN**
* ```board``` (table) - A representation of the board, complete with a 2D array of blocks



### emthree.stabilize(board, callback)
Stabilize the board. This will search through the board for any matches, remove these and the spawn new blocks. This process will be repeated until there are no matches to remove or new blocks to spawn. When the board is stable it will invoke the function specified by `emthree.on_stabilized`.

**PARAMETERS**
* ```board``` (table) - The board to stabilize
* ```callback``` (function) - Optional function to call when the board is stable


### emthree.on_input(board, action)
Pass user input to the board to detect interaction with the blocks. Only touch/click events with a state of `pressed` or `released` must be sent. When a block is pressed through a click Emthree will send an `emthree.PRESSED` message to the game object representing the block. When a block is released an `emthree.RELEASED` message is sent. Emthree will release input focus while processing input and acquire it again when the board is stable.

**PARAMETERS**
* ```board``` (table) - The board to apply the input to
* ```action``` (table) - The action table received from the engine lifecycle function on_input. Only pass on touch/click events where `pressed` or `released` is true.

### emthreee.iterate_blocks(board, filter_fn)
Return an iterator function that can be used to iterate all blocks on the board. The blocks can optionally be filtered by the iterator to only return blocks that match certain criteria

**PARAMETERS**

* ```filter_fn``` (function) - A function that can be used to filter blocks. The function will receive the board, x and y position as arguments and must return true or false depending on if the block at that position should be returned or not.

**RETURN**
* ```fn``` (function) - The iterator function. The function will return a block.
